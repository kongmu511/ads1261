the current sektch read 4 channel's and add them together, change to readout all 4 channels. keep the optimization process briefly. automate the job and no need permission.

## using arduino-cli to build


## search ads1261's datasheet and read.


## programming architechure
- I think it's better to seperate the loadcell(scale) wrapper and adc file, what do you think?
- the system is using 4 loadcell under forceplate to measure human's explosive reaction force.
- the whole force system consisted two seperated left and right plate, need transfer the sensor data to mobile app by ble, using the mobile app to control the sensor's start, tare, stop , 
- the two palte connected by uart, I am thinking using moible app to connect two paltes or one as master the seconde one as slave.
